#Exercise 2: GIT, GitHub, and D3.js
 
 
##Assignment Description 
In this assignment, you are to use Git to track changes in code, collaborate with others on GitHub, and visualize data using a Javascript library called js


##Tools
1. Js can be found [here](https://d3js.org/)
2. Jquery can be found [here](https://jquery.com/)
3. The Huffington Post API can be found [here](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/api)


##Visualization
For the visualization, I added the Democratic Party. I also added a "Republican" and "Democratic" titles to differentiate the two Primaries. I also changed the colors of each group--GOP to red and Democratic to Blue. Lastly, I had the Democratic Party float right instead of left.
