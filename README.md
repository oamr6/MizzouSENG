* Visualize data using a JavaScript libraby called js.

We must create two commits

1. Create an orginal README file.
2. Make a change to the visualization and customize the D3.js file.

##Tools used

##Visualization
For the visualization, Teddy added the Democratic party primary bar graph and changed the color to red. Also changed the font size to 2em. Teddy overrided all their changes to keep the poll chart simple.
For Olivia's visualization she added the Democratic Party. Olivia also added a "Republican" and "Democratic" titles to differentiate the two Primaries. Olivia also changed the colors of each group--GOP to red and Democratic to Blue. Lastly, Olivia had the Democratic Party float right instead of left

For Soya's visualization he changed
* I changed the margin from 5-15px
* I changed the bars from coral to royalblue
* I changed the float from left to right

For Andrea's visualization, she changed app file to background to pink, float to right, and margins to 10px
